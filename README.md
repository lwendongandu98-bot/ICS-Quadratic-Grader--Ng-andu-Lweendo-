This repository contains a simple, single-page web application built using HTML and vanilla JavaScript. It addresses two distinct computational tasks:
     1.Solving Quadratic Equations: Calculates the real or complex roots of a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0).
     2.Converting Numeric Scores to Letter Grades: Determines a student's letter grade based on a numeric score and a specified grading scale.
     The entire application logic is contained within the index.html file, making it easy to deploy and run.
     Features
     a)Quadratic Solver:
     .Accepts coefficients a,b,andc as input.
     .Calculates the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots.
     .Outputs two distinct real roots, one repeated real root, or two complex roots.
     .Includes input validation to prevent division by zero.
     b)Grade Converter:
Accepts a numeric score between 0 and 100.
Applies a standard grading scale (A+, A, B+, etc.) to return the corresponding letter grade.
How to Run the Application
This project requires no server or special setup.
Clone the repository or download the index.html file.
Open index.html directly in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
Enter values into the input fields and click the "Solve" or "Convert" buttons to see the results.
